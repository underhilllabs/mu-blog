## First Annual SeamusCon

I'm calling the last week of board games **Seamus Con 2018**, in honor of my cat Seamus as he just had his 12 year adoptiversary and he loves to walk across board games. Also it was my birthday week. I got Seamus as a birthday present 12 years ago.

## The highlights

On Sunday, I went to a Board Game meetup and played games for 6 hours. It was a blast! Games played:

### Azul

My first game and first win!

### Inis

An exciting game was played. The winner won very tricksily. He very possibly could've defeated Peter Baelish in that final round. He feigned defeat and then played 2 cards in succession to win. He was playing white and thru his final maneuver became Brenn over 7 opponents in the Capitol. I need to get this game back into my regular rotation.

### Gaia Project

I was beaten quite badly but that only seems to make me love it more. I played the Nevars for the first time and loved their special ability, each power token is worth 2 power, but brought it out too late.
