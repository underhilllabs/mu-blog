<h2>The Data Step</h2>
<h3>Subsetting IF</h3>
In a Data Step you can exclude some observations from the dataset with an if statement.

```r
data tornados_1980s;
  infile FileName;
  input year city damages;
  * this limits input data to 1980s data;
  if 1980 <= year <= 1989;
run;
```

<li> IF .. IN statement

```r
if year in (1980, 1981, 1982);
```

<li> AND, OR 

```r
if year = '1980' and city = 'Baltimore';
``` 


<h3>infile 'filename'</h3>
In the data step, import data from a file with the infile command.

```r
data tornados;
  infile 'tornados.dat';
  input year city cost;
run;
```

<h3>Set </h3>
<li> Use the set command to create a new data set from an already created
  set.
The following creates a dataset of 1980s tornado data from the larger
set of tornado data.

```r
data tornados_1980s;
  set tornados;
  if 1980 <= year <= 1989;
run;
```

<h2>The PROC Step</h2>
<h3>PROC SORT</h3>
<li> The sort procedure, sorts data. You can sort by multiple fields.
<li> Also you can print by a field.

```r
proc sort data=tornados;
  by year city;
proc print data=tornados;
  by year;
run;
```

<h3>PROC Univariate</h3>
PROC Univariate generates descriptive statistics

```r
proc univariate data=tornados;
  histogram year;
run;
```

<h3>PROC means</h3>
Use proc means when you are only interested in basic descriptive statistics.
<h3>PROC freq</h3>
<li> generates tables for data in categories.
<h3>PROC gplot</h3>

```r
proc gplot data=tornados;
  plot year*cost;
  title 'Year by Cost tornados';
run;
```

<h3>PROC corr</h3>
<h4>compute the correlation</h4>

```r
proc corr data=grades;
  var exam1 exam2 hwscore;
run;
```

<h3>PROC reg</h3>
<li> p: prints obs, predicted, residuals
<li> r: same as p, plus more
<li> clm: 95% conf interval for mean of each obs
<li> cli: 95% prediction intervals.

```r
proc reg data=grades;
  model final=exam1 hwscore / p r cli clm;
  plot final*hwscore;
run;
```

<h2>Multiple Regression Analysis</h2>
<h3>Variable Selection</h3>
SAS has several methods for selecting variables

```r
proc reg data=cdi;
  model y = x1-x8 /selection=rsquare best=1;
  model y = x1-x8 /selection=adjrsq best=5;
  model y = x1-x8 /selection=cp best=10;
  model y = x1-x8 /selection=forward slentry=0.10;
  model y = x1-x8 /selection=stepwise slentry=0.10 slstay=0.10;
  model y = x1-x8 /selection=backward slstay=0.10;
run;
```
