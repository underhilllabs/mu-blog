This was everyones first time playing Martin Wallace's *a Handful of Stars*. I had purchased the game on a whim
back in March and have been trying to get it to the table since then. On Tuesday
night some members of the Denver GMT+ group being Martin Wallace fans were kind enough to
give it a play. A couple of the players, Jason and Robert, had
played and enjoyed the game's spiritual predecessor *a Few Feet of Snow* and so were familiar with some of the
game's mechanisms, this helped make the initial teach smooth and other than a few
questions the game seemed quick to pick up.

## The Setup

I shuffled and dealt out a race to each player. Robert was dealt the Peacenyms, James
received the Technoids, Jason got the Exploremords and I would be playing the
Aggroloids. *Dang! I really wanted to be a bot :)* The name of each of the factions subtly
spells out their main starting strategies. Despite my initial hesitation, I lucked into
the faction with the most straight-forward strategy: attack with overwhelming force and
expand.

Next I dealt out the 3 starting habitable systems and the 3 starting
uninhabitable systems. I was fortunate to draw a habitable system Zooth that bordered a remote area of 3 or 4 neutral
worlds. I named Zooth my homeworld and my warriors battle cry became: *For Zooth!*
 My initial plan was to slowly take-over the neutral systems Northwest of Zooth.

## The Opening

The Peacenyms, who began the game with a consolidated position with 4 systems in the bottom edge of
the galaxy, started the game off "peacefully" by attacking and colonizing one of the
Exploremords habitable systems near their Federation. The other players soon found out, that with 2 
space mine cards in their reserve, once the Peacenyms annexed a territory it was very
difficult to get it back. Next, James, with the Technoids, placed an outpost on an uninhabitable system.

The other 3 factions simultaneously selected the southern part of the board as the
location of their home world, *Crowded Neighborhood*

When it was my turn I first placed the Super Dreadnoughts in my
reserve, this is an amazing race ability card that added +4 combat strength to any force of mine with a fleet, and then moved
in and conquered the habitable system Trebone. It was always exciting to
flip over the alien neutral combat token to see how powerful the force you were up against
was: the range was 1-9, but it feel like we mostly bumped against the higher part of the
range. :)

By the time the Exploremords took their first turn they were down to 2 habitable systems
that were hemmed in by other factions. Also there was no place for them to jet to with
their exploration abilities.

## The Mid-Game

The Peacenyms and the Exploremords built up forces in the south, while the Aggroloids
continued their plan of annexing the neutral systems in the Northwest. The Technoids made
some inroads into Aggroloid territory overrunning a couple uninhabitable systems in the
Center North and also developing wormhole technology first.

## Finale

The power of the Aggroloids Star Bombs and Super Dreadnoughts and the Peacenyms now 3
Space Mine reserve led to a slight lead by these factions.  The other factions made a last
ditch effort to attack the Aggroloids and the Peacenyms weak spots. The Technoids
destroyed the Aggro colony on Elliope, bringing in a force through a wormhole, and
colonized the system for themselves. These last round losses were not enough to even the
score and the Aggroloids and Peacenyms shared a victory at 43 vp. (They also had the same
ammount of systems which is the tie-breaker.)


## Final Thoughts

One thing I loved about this game was the natural narrative arcs of each faction. I'd
read this in another session report, and was bit doubtful, and yet at the end of the game
everyone was competing telling war stories of their game. I feel like this is a function of
the races with their race ability cards, the inspiring art and also the engaging
gameplay. I really enjoyed the game, emptying my hand in combat and excitedly redrawing. I
never felt like I ever had a weak hand, just some (when I had a star bomb and rapid
reaction force) were stronger than others.

With 4 players a game really starts in the middle of the action. A majority of the systems are
already spoken for and the factions start feverishly grabbing the rest, so there is no
slow build in this game. Also the endgame trigger of 20 shuffles kept the game moving.

One potential weakspot of the game was also a fun part of it, the opening system
draw. Some players are going to start with better opening positions. Also, I loved the
asymmetrical factions, but my Aggroloids were a better fit for the crowded 4 player start than
other factions and my opening cards felt very powerful. However I did feel by the end
of the game, I was very short on research abilities. Never having more than 2 or 3
research available. So perhaps as the game progresses the factions start to balance out.

Another weakness that other players mentioned was the downtime between turns, when there
was one or two combats between your turns you were in for a bit of wait and the board
state would be quite different and therefore often require that you rethink your next move
when it became your turn.

I loved the art of the game. The system and technology cards and the main board are all beautifully
illustrated. I loved all of the system names from Arcturus to Flatbush to Zooth. And the
different factions really begged for coming up with stories about what they were doing on
every turn. The fleet and starbase tiles are a bit underdone, but you quickly forget about
the white cardboard underside and just look at the planet art and the cards.

I really enjoyed playing the game, and can't wait to play again with new factions, though
I do sort of fear coming up against the Star Bomb and Super Dreadnoughts when they're
in someone else's hand :)
