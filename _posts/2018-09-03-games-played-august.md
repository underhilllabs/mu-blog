## New Games

#### Root

I played Root for the first time at the GMT(+) Meetup. I really loved the asymmetrical
warfare in this game and the beautiful art. I love it so much, I wrote my first <a href="http://majorursa.net/2018/08/29/root-first-session-report.html">session report</a>.

#### Brass: Birmingham

I played this for the first time at the Lakewood Euro-games meetup. Kelvin and I both
enjoyed it so much we bought copies of the game the next day. Instant top 10 game for
me. I love the combination of hand management, economic engine and network building.
