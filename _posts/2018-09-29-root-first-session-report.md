## Root First Play
On Tuesday I attended my first Denver GMT+ Meetup. It was a friendly group of players. Prior to this game, Mike the Marquise, had played once as the Vagabond. I, Woodland Alliance, had watched a few playthrough videos and memorized the manuals :), Robert, the Eyrie, had also watched an instruction video, and our hapless Vagabond, was completely new to the game, but was a very quick study.

The Vagabond, selected the ranger and the Builder seized control of the Eyrie.
